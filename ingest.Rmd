# Collecting the Data

First things first, we need to acquire yearly datasets of crashes from the ARIES repository. They let you do so either by downloading csv files or by querying their API. I started with the API first, but ran into trouble when certain years wouldn't respond to my queries. I found that these same datasets would [return an error message](https://i.postimg.cc/wvxV7W9b/ARIES-server-not-responding.png) when trying to preview on the repository as well. Here we will take the approach of downloading all the datasets to disk as csv files before working with them.
